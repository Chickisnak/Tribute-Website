      <p class="Para-1">
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and
        statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,
        Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
        science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
        Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military
        missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development
        of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
        political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India
        in 1974.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="Para-1">
        Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
        Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",he
        returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term.He was a recipient
        of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="Para-1">
        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
        apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the
        funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Early life and Education</h2>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p class="Para-1">
        In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a
        strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.After completing his education at
        the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College,
        Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.He
        moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While Kalam was working
        on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his
        scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the
        Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".He
        narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only
        eight positions were available in the IAF.
        <br><br>
        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
        Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of
        India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started
        his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was
        also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969,
        Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of
        India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth
        orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in
        1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Career as a Scientist</h2>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p class="Para-1">
        In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in
        Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to
        develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="Para-1">
        Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
        representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also
        directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the
        technology of the successful SLV programme.Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira
        Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's
        directorship.Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these
        classified aerospace projects.His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in
        the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.Kalam
        and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by
        the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles
        instead of taking planned missiles one after another.R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet
        approval for allocating ₹3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme
        (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under
        the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface
        missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="Para-1">
        Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and
        Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during
        this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project
        Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.Media coverage of Kalam during this
        period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist.However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam,
        said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report.[33]
        Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="Para-1">
        In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju
        Stent".In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the
        "Kalam-Raju Tablet".

      <h2>Presidency</h2>
      <hr>
      <p class="Para-1">
        Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election
        with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25
        July 2002, to 25 July 2007.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="Para-1">
        On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they
        would nominate Kalam for the post of President,and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party
        backed his candidacy.After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a
        second term in office, leaving the field clear.Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:
        <br><br>
        I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was
        thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.
        <br>
        On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior
        Cabinet colleagues.
        <br>
        <br>
        The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with
        the media claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the
        count was held on 18 July.Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,and moved
        into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.Kalam was the third President of India to have been
        honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli
        Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the
        President of India.He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.
        <br>
        <br>
        During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President,saying that signing the
        Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.Kalam was criticised for his
        inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure.Article 72
        of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death
        sentence of convicts on death row.Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president,
        rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.Perhaps the most notable plea was from
        Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian
        Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.[58] While the sentence was
        scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining
        on death row.He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.
